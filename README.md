# containers-cpp

Standard set of containers implemented in modern c++.

## Containers
* [list](01-list/list.cc)
    * Single linked list.
    * Example: reverse a single linked list.
* [stack](02-stack/stack.cc)
    * Stack.
    * LIFO access order.
* [queue](03-queue/queue.cc)
    * Queue.
    * FIFO access order.
* [deque](04-deque/deque.cc)
    * Double-ended queue.
    * Constant time access to front and back.
* [tree](05-tree//tree.cc)
    * Binary tree.
    * Examples: tree height, tree size.
* [bst](06-bst/bst.cc)
    * Binary search tree.
    * Logarithmic insertion and retrieval.
    * Example: find node by value.
* [heap](07-heap/heap.cc)
    * Heap.
    * Constant time access to maximum or minimum.
    * Logarithmic insertion time.
* [trie](08-trie/trie.cc)
    * Search by prefix.
* [graph](09-graph/graph.cc)
    * Adjacency list representation of a graph.
    * Breadth first search.
        * Single source shortest path in unweighted graph.
    * Depth first search.
        * Toplogical sort of vertices.
* [hashtable](10-hashtable/hashtable.cc)
    * Constant time insert and find.
* [union_find](11-union-find/union_find.cc)
    * Disjoint-set.
    * Fast set membership lookup.
* [maxstack](12-maxstack/maxstack.cc)
    * Stack with constant time access to maximum value.
* [maxqueue](13-maxqueue/maxqueue.cc)
    * Queue with constant time access to maximum value.
